# cheers_take2
The Ruby cheers exercise (see: luketlancaster/cheers), this time 3 weeks into learning Ruby, with tests.

## Instructions
(What we're supposed to do)

## Specifications
(How the program works)

Start the program by running `./cheers.rb`

The program should ask:

> Hello, what is your name?

The user types n their name, for example:

> Luke

The proogram outputs a cheer in the following format:

> Give me a... L
> Give me an... U
> Give me a... K
> Give me an... E
> Lukeâ€™s just GRAND!

* Follow the proper grammatial for a and an. The rule is based on
  wheather the selling of a letter would begin with a vowel.
* Ignore all special characters (i.e. non-word characters) when
  printing the cheer
* Print the user's name as it was originally input for final cheer
* If there was no input, ask again


After printing out ther eser;s cheer, the program asks

> Hey, Luke, what's your birthday? (mm/dd)

The user types in their birthdate

> 03/15

* If there was no input, asks again unti valid input is provided
* If there was input that couldn't be parsed, the program tries
  again, but with the prompt:

> I couldn't understand that. Could you give that to me in mm/dd
> format?

The program then outputs the number of days until the user's birthday

> Awesome! Your birthday is in 132 days! Happy birthday in advance!
